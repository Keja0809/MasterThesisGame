# Master Thesis Game

This project is part of the master thesis of Kerstin Limberger.

It serves to support the thesis discussed in the paper. It deals with the possibility that video game based approaches can reveal anti-Muslim racism in Germany.

The game was programmed with the game engine Unity. C# scripts and the plug-in "Fungus" were used. The dialog scenes were implemented with this plug-in.

The avatars used were purchased from the Asset Store.
